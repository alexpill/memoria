# Memoria

A local-first knowledge base manager built in Rust. Write notes in Markdown, organize them with tags, backlinks, and metadata, and access them from a powerful CLI interface. Future extensions include:

- A GUI built with Tauri
- RSS feed aggregation
- AI enrichment (summarize blogs, docs, etc.)
- MCP server for AI agents to query and edit the knowledge base

## Features

- Markdown-based note storage
- Tags, backlinks, frontmatter metadata
- CLI interface to search, link, edit
- Future GUI via Tauri/Web
- Plugin system for scraping & AI enrichment
- RSS & blog watcher (planned)
- MCP-compatible backend (planned)

## Philosophy

- Hacker-friendly
- Fully offline/local-first
- Extensible, composable, and cross-platform
